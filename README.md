# AND101 Project 1 - Hello, Squirrel!

Submitted by: **Mariia Onokhina**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Hello, Squirrel!** is an android app that recreates the common "Hello, World!", to introduce ourselves to the neighborhood squirrel üêø. 
Layout of the existing version of the app was changed.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üò°, üí°, üíª**

## Notes

- At first, I couldn't figure out what lines to modify, but the hints section helped.
- I tried to modify the look of the app and made some small changes to the UI, moving things around.
- I had problems uploading my code to GitHub due to some merge conflicts, but I figured it out using ChatGPT.
